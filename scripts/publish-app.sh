# publish-app.sh — Shared "publish a .app to a running BC instance" helper.
#
# Designed to be SOURCED, not executed:
#
#   . "$REPO_DIR/scripts/publish-app.sh"
#   bc_publish_app /path/to/myapp.app
#   bc_publish_app /path/to/myapp.app "http://localhost:7049/BC/dev" "${BC_USERNAME:-admin}:${BC_PASSWORD:-admin}"
#
# Returns 0 on success — meaning either:
#   - HTTP 200 (fresh publish completed), or
#   - HTTP 422 with "already" in the body (same version already installed,
#     which BC reports as 422 even though it isn't a real error).
#
# Returns 1 (and prints a diagnostic dump) for everything else, including
# any other 4xx/5xx and 422s whose body does NOT contain "already". The
# most common 422 failure is "missing dependency" — when the .app declares
# a dependency on another extension that isn't installed in the BC
# database. The pre-2026 version of this code treated ALL 422s as
# "already installed" and silently swallowed missing-dep failures, which
# made for many wasted debugging cycles in downstream consumers like
# bc-copilot-blueprint. Now those failures are loud and have a clear
# error body printed.
