# Sequential Throughput Optimization Ideas

Current state: ~0.33s/method average (Bucket 4, single runner, headless Linux).
Goal: identify where time is spent and reduce irreducible overhead.

## Experiment Results

### Profiling (dotnet-trace, 2 min sample during ERM execution)

Key finding: **47% of time is UNMANAGED_CODE_TIME** (SQL Server processing),
only **2% is CPU_TIME**. This is an I/O-bound workload, not CPU-bound.

Top hot methods:
- `UNMANAGED_CODE_TIME`: 564s (47%) — SQL query processing, locks, transactions
- `AsyncMethodBuilderCore.Start`: 146s — async machinery overhead
- `TestClientProxy.Invoke`: 32s — test page client reflection
- `CallServerSync`: 25s — synchronous client→server RPC
- `BindingManager.DoFill`: 12.7s — page data binding
- `NstDataAccess.GetPage`: 12.5s — server-side page retrieval
- `ActionField` chain: 9.9s — field validation roundtrips

### Experiment 1: SQL Network Co-location (Docker bridge vs host network)

Hypothesis: Docker bridge network adds latency to BC↔SQL communication.
Result: **No measurable difference.**

| Setup | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Avg |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-----|
| Docker bridge (warm) | 76s | 74s | 65s | **72s** |
| Host network (warm) | 71s | 69s | — | **70s** |

Test: 5 codeunits, 301 methods from Tests-SINGLESERVER.
Conclusion: Network hop adds ~0.1ms/call which is negligible. The 47% unmanaged
time is SQL Server's internal processing (query compilation, locking, buffer ops),
not network latency. **Docker bridge is fine.**

### Experiment 2: Server GC (DOTNET_gcServer=1)

Hypothesis: Server GC reduces pause frequency, improving throughput.
Historical result: an older build broke the API endpoint when Server GC was
enabled. Current BC 28 Linux images run with `DOTNET_gcServer=1` and the
network API surface on port 7048 is part of the supported test path, so treat
this experiment as superseded unless you are reproducing that older image.

Baseline (Workstation GC): 62-64s avg (3 runs, warm).
Server GC: superseded by current runtime defaults.

### Experiment 3: SQL Server Tuning (MAXDOP, ad hoc, cost threshold)

Hypothesis: BC generates many small queries; MAXDOP=1 and ad hoc optimization
should reduce SQL overhead.

Applied: `max degree of parallelism`=1, `cost threshold for parallelism`=50,
`optimize for ad hoc workloads`=1.

| Setup | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Avg |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-----|
| Baseline (defaults) | 62s | 60s | 61s | **61s** |
| SQL tuned | 65s | 61s | 61s | **62s** |

**No difference.** BC's queries are already single-threaded (small, simple),
plan cache is already warm, and ad hoc optimization doesn't help because the
same queries repeat. The 47% SQL time is irreducible query processing overhead.

### Summary

Three experiments tested, none improved throughput:
1. Network co-location: no effect (Docker bridge overhead negligible)
2. Server GC: breaks BC's API endpoint
3. SQL tuning: no effect (queries already optimal for this workload)

The ~0.2s/method execution speed appears to be the floor for the current
architecture. Further gains require structural changes (RPC short-circuit,
session pooling) or parallelization across multiple BC instances.

## Remaining Ideas to Test

### TCP Tuning (Nagle's Algorithm)
BC↔SQL communication uses TCP. Nagle's algorithm buffers small packets before
sending, adding latency to each of the thousands of tiny SQL round-trips.
Disabling Nagle (`TCP_NODELAY`) could reduce per-call latency. This would NOT
have shown up in bridge-vs-host test since both had Nagle enabled.

### SQL Forced Parameterization
BC may send ad-hoc SQL text for each query. `ALTER DATABASE CRONUS SET
PARAMETERIZATION FORCED` makes SQL Server reuse execution plans more
aggressively, reducing plan compilation overhead per query.

### SQL Packet Size
Default network packet size is 4096 bytes. Tuning this (smaller for many tiny
queries, larger for result sets) could reduce per-round-trip overhead.

### Transaction Log on tmpfs
Data files are on tmpfs but the log file may be on Docker overlay filesystem.
Every commit writes to the log. Check and move if needed.

### SQL Memory
Currently `MSSQL_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB=2048`. More RAM = larger buffer pool and plan
cache. Test with 4096 or unlimited.

### CPU Affinity
Pin BC and SQL to separate CPU cores to avoid context switching overhead.
`--cpuset-cpus` in Docker.

## Experiment Results (continued)

### Experiment 4: SQL Forced Parameterization
`ALTER DATABASE CRONUS SET PARAMETERIZATION FORCED`
Result: **No improvement.** 64s avg vs 62s baseline. May hurt because BC's
queries rely on literal values for optimal plans. *Platform-agnostic.*

### Experiment 5: SQL Memory (4096MB vs default unlimited)
`EXEC sp_configure 'max server memory', 4096`
Result: **No improvement.** 64s avg vs 62s baseline. Working set fits in
default memory allocation. *Platform-agnostic.*

### Experiments blocked by BC compatibility
- **Server GC** (DOTNET_gcServer=1): Breaks API endpoint
- **Tiered compilation off** (DOTNET_TieredCompilation=0): Breaks API endpoint
- **Quick JIT for loops** (DOTNET_TC_QuickJitForLoops=1): Breaks API endpoint
All JIT/GC changes are incompatible with BC's HttpSysStub. *Linux-only issue
(HttpSysStub is the Linux replacement for Windows HttpSys).*

### Experiment 6: TCP Nagle / Low Latency
Could not modify sysctl inside containers (read-only filesystem).
No measurable effect. 68s avg vs 62s baseline (noise). *Platform-agnostic.*

### Experiment 7: CPU Affinity (cpuset-cpus)
Pinned SQL to cores 0,1 and BC to cores 2,3 on a 12-core machine.
Result: **50% slower** (94s warm avg vs 62s). Starving both processes of
cores is worse than letting the OS schedule freely. BC uses many async
threads; SQL Server needs cores for internal task scheduling.
*Platform-agnostic.*

### Experiment 8: Transaction Log Location
Verified: both data (.mdf) and log (.ldf) are on `/var/opt/mssql/data` which
is tmpfs (RAM). Log I/O is not a bottleneck. Combined with DELAYED_DURABILITY
= FORCED, log writes are already minimal. SQL Server does not support disabling
the transaction log entirely — it's fundamental to ACID. *Platform-agnostic.*

### What actually helped
Only SQL overhead removal (Experiment 3b) produced measurable improvement.
Small benchmark (301 methods): **13% faster** (64s → 56s).
Full ERM benchmark (9,320 methods): **23% faster** (70.5 min → 54.4 min).

| Benchmark | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 5 codeunits (301 methods) | 64s | 56s | **-13%** |
| Full ERM (9,320 methods) | 70.5 min | 54.4 min | **-23%** |

The larger improvement at scale suggests SQL overhead (query store, stats
updates) compounds over thousands of operations. *All platform-agnostic.*

Settings applied:
- Query store OFF
- Auto statistics OFF (update + create + async)
- Page verify NONE
- Delayed durability FORCED
- Change tracking OFF

## 1. Profile First — Find the Bottleneck

Before optimizing, attach `dotnet-trace` or `dotnet-counters` to the BC process
during a test run. Answer: what percentage of wall time is session setup vs AL
execution vs SQL vs GC vs idle/waiting?

```bash
# Collect a trace during a small test run
dotnet-trace collect -p $(pgrep -f Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Server) --duration 00:02:00
# Analyze with speedscope or dotnet-trace convert
```

If 40% is session overhead → patches will help a lot.
If 90% is AL execution → not much to squeeze sequentially.

## 2. Session Overhead Reduction

Each codeunit in isolation mode (130450) creates a fresh BC session. This involves:
- Extension loading / validation
- Permission set evaluation
- Feature flag / entitlement checks
- Telemetry context setup
- Azure AD / identity initialization

**Ideas:**
- Patch session init to skip non-essential steps (feature flags, entitlements,
  telemetry context). Similar to existing StartupHook patches but targeting
  `NavSession` or `NavServerSession` initialization.
- CRIU at session level — checkpoint a "warm session" state after first init,
  restore it for subsequent codeunits instead of creating from scratch. This
  is speculative but could eliminate per-codeunit startup cost entirely.
- Pre-warm the extension metadata cache so each new session doesn't re-validate.

## 3. More Runtime Overhead Stripping

Already patched: Watson, SideService, Reporting, AzureAD, ShowForm.

**Candidates to investigate:**
- Telemetry/diagnostics collection during test execution (NavOpenTelemetry,
  TraceWriter). Even with no-op logger, the call sites may do work before
  reaching the no-op.
- Permission checks — in test mode, SUPER user runs everything. Can we short-
  circuit the permission evaluation path?
- Event subscriber resolution — BC resolves subscribers dynamically on each
  event raise. Could we cache the resolution table?
- Extension dependency validation — checked on every session but never changes
  during a test run.

## 4. .NET Runtime Tuning

**JIT / Tiered Compilation:**
```bash
# Force aggressive optimization (skip tier 0 interpretation)
export DOTNET_TieredCompilation=1
export DOTNET_TC_QuickJitForLoops=1
# Or disable tiered compilation entirely (immediate full JIT)
export DOTNET_TieredCompilation=0
```

**GC Tuning:**
```bash
# Server GC with larger generations (reduce pause frequency)
export DOTNET_gcServer=1
export DOTNET_GCHeapCount=4
# Reduce GC pressure during test bursts
export DOTNET_GCConserveMemory=0
```

**ReadyToRun:**
- The BC service DLLs ship as R2R (pre-compiled). Test extension DLLs do not.
  Pre-compiling hot test DLLs with crossgen2 could help startup.

## 5. SQL Micro-Optimizations

tmpfs for data files showed no improvement (SQL buffer pool handles caching).
But there may be other angles:
- `OPTIMIZE_FOR_SEQUENTIAL_KEY` on hot test tables
- Increase SQL memory allocation (currently 2GB default)
- Disable SQL telemetry / query store during test runs
- Pre-create temp tables used by test framework

## 6. Test Runner Efficiency

- Batch multiple codeunits per session where isolation isn't strictly needed
  (risky — some tests leave dirty state)
- Reduce OData/API round-trip overhead between the host runner and BC
- Pipeline the next codeunit setup while current one is executing

## 7. Wild Ideas

- **Patch the AL interpreter hot loop** — if profiling shows a specific method
  in Nav.Ncl's AL execution engine is hot, a targeted JMP hook could optimize it
- **Server-side batch execution endpoint** for test runner ↔ BC communication,
  while keeping the host-facing contract HTTP-only
- **Snapshot/restore at DB level** between codeunits (SQL Server snapshots are
  near-instant) instead of relying on transaction rollback

## Linux-Exclusive Experiments

### Experiment 9: TuneD mssql sysctl Profile
**Blocked: requires sudo.** Could not apply sysctl changes in this session.
Key parameters to test: `vm.swappiness=1`, `vm.dirty_ratio=80`,
`net.ipv4.tcp_low_latency=1`. THP and CPU governor already optimal on host.
```bash
sudo sysctl -w vm.swappiness=1 vm.dirty_background_ratio=3 vm.dirty_ratio=80 \
  vm.dirty_expire_centisecs=500 vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs=100 \
  vm.max_map_count=1600000 net.ipv4.tcp_low_latency=1
```

### Experiment 10: SQL Trace Flag 3979 + writethrough
**TF 3979:** "not supported" by mssql-conf on SQL Server 2022-latest image.
May need specific CU level or RHEL-based image.
**control.writethrough=1:** Crashed SQL Server — tmpfs doesn't support O_DSYNC.
Both settings are moot when data is on tmpfs (no real disk I/O to optimize).

### Testing sysctl in CI
The sysctl experiments (Exp 9) need sudo which is available on GitHub Actions
runners. Run the TuneD mssql profile benchmark in a CI pipeline for proper
testing on standardized hardware.

## Linux-Exclusive Ideas (Still To Test)

### Microsoft TuneD `mssql` sysctl Profile
Official Microsoft/Red Hat kernel tuning for SQL Server on Linux.
Key parameters: `force_latency=5` (prevents CPU deep sleep between tiny ops),
`vm.transparent_hugepages=always`, `vm.swappiness=1`, `vm.dirty_ratio=80`.
Apply via `docker run --sysctl` or on the Docker host.
Test: apply sysctls, run 5-codeunit benchmark, compare to 56s baseline.
*Linux-exclusive — no Windows equivalent for these kernel parameters.*

### TCP_QUICKACK (Linux-only socket option)
Disables delayed ACKs per-socket. Windows has no equivalent. Our Experiment 6
failed because containers had read-only sysctl. Proper test: run container with
`--sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_low_latency=1` or use LD_PRELOAD shim to set
TCP_NODELAY + TCP_QUICKACK on all sockets created by BC process.
There's a known SqlClient-on-Linux performance issue (dotnet/SqlClient#422)
related to TCP behavior with MARS.
Test: strace/tcpdump to confirm delayed ACKs occur, then apply fix.
*Linux-exclusive — TCP_QUICKACK is a Linux-only socket option.*

### SQL Server Trace Flag 3979 (FUA/Write-Through)
Linux-specific optimization for XFS filesystem. Microsoft's own testing showed
~50% I/O reduction for write-intensive workloads. Our data is on tmpfs so
impact may be minimal, but transaction log writes may still benefit.
Test: `mssql-conf set traceflag 3979 on` + `control.writethrough 1`.
*Linux-exclusive — optimizes XFS FUA path that only exists on Linux.*

## Priority Order

1. **Profile** — without data, everything else is guessing
2. **Session overhead patches** — likely highest ROI if profiling confirms
3. **.NET tuning** — low effort, potentially meaningful
4. **Runtime stripping** — incremental gains, each patch helps a little
5. **SQL tuning** — probably minimal impact but cheap to try
6. **Test runner efficiency** — small gains
7. **Wild ideas** — high risk, explore only if profiling points there
