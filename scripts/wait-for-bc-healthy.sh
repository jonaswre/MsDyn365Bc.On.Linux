#!/usr/bin/env bash
# wait-for-bc-healthy.sh — Block until the BC docker container reports
# the docker healthcheck as `healthy`. Fails fast on `unhealthy` or on
# the container disappearing entirely.
#
# Usage (run from a directory containing docker-compose.yml):
#   ./scripts/wait-for-bc-healthy.sh [timeout-minutes]
#
# Defaults to 30 minutes. Polls every 5 seconds and prints a progress
# line from the most recent [entrypoint] log message every 60 seconds
# so you can see what BC is doing without staring at silence.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  BC reached `healthy` within the timeout
#   1  BC reached `unhealthy`, the container died, or the timeout
#      expired. The last 100 lines of `docker compose logs bc` are
#      printed before exit so the failure context is preserved.
#
# This is a single canonical implementation of the BC-readiness loop
# that the previous codebase had inlined into bc-test-from-source.yml,
# bc-test-prebuilt.yml, test-versions.yml (twice — test job AND
# test-container-download job), AND iterate.sh in the bc-copilot-blueprint
# repo. Five copies in five files, all subtly different. The bc-copilot
# debugging session in 2026 made it clear that this needs to be one
# script — bug fixes here propagate everywhere instead of leaving four
# stale duplicates behind.
