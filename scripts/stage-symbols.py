"""
stage-symbols.py — Manifest-driven .alpackages staging for AL compile.

Walks a BC artifact tree, indexes every .app file by its declared id, then
copies into the output directory exactly the symbols a consumer's
project needs to compile: System.app + the transitive dependency closure
of every consumer app.json passed in.

This replaces the older glob-based staging that lived inline in
bc-test-from-source.yml. The glob approach broke whenever Microsoft
moved an app to a different folder. Indexing by manifest is robust to
those moves: an app is found by its declared id no matter where in the
artifact it sits.

Usage:
  stage-symbols.py \\
      --app-json <consumer-app-json> [--app-json <more>] \\
      --artifact-dir <bc-artifact-root> \\
      --out-dir <symbols-target-dir>

The script always stages System.app (the AL platform symbols) since AL
compile cannot proceed without it, even when no consumer dep references
it explicitly.

Exit codes:
  0 success
  1 missing input or unrecoverable failure
  2 one or more consumer dependencies could not be resolved against
    the artifact set (a warning is also printed)
